## Documented Practices

### 1. Coordinated Astroturfing Campaigns

RevisionDojo has been documented running coordinated campaigns on Reddit where accounts pose as students sharing "cheatsheets" and "predicted exam leaks." Additional accounts then upvote, leave supportive comments, and ask follow-up questions—creating the appearance of organic student enthusiasm.

**Evidence:**

- [Thread exposing the pattern](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1p55qun/why_is_everyone_talking_about_these_revision_dojo/>)
- [Fake "predicted exams" post](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1jsb00a/revision_dojo_predicted_exams_for_anyone_who/>)
- [Fake "cheatsheets" post](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1ohcohi/revisiondojo_cheatsheets/>)
- [Students calling out the practice](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/revisiondojo_is_scamming_on_this_subreddit/>)

**Moderator response:** The r/IBO moderators have confirmed they are [actively investigating](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/comment/nagdkl5/>).

### 2. Paying Students for Fake Posts

High school students have reported being offered payment to write promotional Reddit posts for RevisionDojo.

**Evidence:**

- [User report of payment offer](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1p55qun/comment/nqmhal3/>)

### 3. Pressuring Users Who Post Criticism

Users who share negative experiences on Reddit report being contacted directly by company representatives. One user reported being told "it's a shame" that they were posting their honest experiences publicly.

**Evidence:**

- [User report of direct contact](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/comment/na94upv/>)
- [Reports of coordinated downvoting of critical comments](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/comment/na8zvs4/>)

### 4. Soliciting Copyrighted Test Materials

RevisionDojo uses TikTok influencers and fake Reddit posts to persuade students to sell them official IB examination materials, which violates IB copyright and examination policies.

**Evidence:**

- [TikTok solicitation video](<https://www.tiktok.com/@ibelieveinyoudojo/video/7524742778299911446>)
- [Warning post about this practice](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1mej900/do_not_sell_upload_any_ib_courseworks_to_nail_ib/>)

### 5. Product Quality Issues

Despite years on the market and significant funding, students consistently report issues with question accuracy, material quality, and customer support.

**Evidence:**

- ["Please never ever use RevisionDojo"](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1lyp9iw/please_never_ever_use_revision_dojo/>)
- ["Don't buy RevisionDojo"](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1jdm54m/dont_buy_revisiondojo/>)
- [Discussion of quality concerns](<https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1megias/is_revision_dojo_good_for_study/>)

## Expansion to SAT Prep: Oneprep Acquisition

In late 2025, RevisionDojo appears to have acquired [Oneprep](oneprep.xyz), a free SAT preparation tool that was popular on r/sat for practicing official College Board questions.

### Evidence of Acquisition

1. **Employment records:** The person managing Oneprep's new Discord server has a public LinkedIn profile showing employment at RevisionDojo since May 2025 in "Content and Product Development for SAT."

2. **Developer departure:** The original Oneprep developer's public LinkedIn profile shows his relationship with Oneprep ended in October 2025.

3. **Platform changes:** Since the transition, Oneprep has:
- Added non-official practice tests [containing errors](<https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1p8p70y/comment/nr83gkp/>)
- [Renamed official College Board content to evade copyright scrutiny](<https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1pcb965/what_is_navybook_bluebook_on_oneprep/>) from "Bluebook" to "Navybook"
- Begun [offering students $20 for TikTok promotions](<https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1p9bcfs/somebody_bought_out_oneprep/>)


### Same Patterns Emerging

Since the acquisition, the same manipulation tactics documented on r/IBO have appeared on r/sat:

1. **Bulk Trustpilot reviews:** Oneprep received approximately 150 Trustpilot reviews in a 9-day window (November 30 – December 8, 2025), with most concentrated on December 4–5. No reviews appear before or after this window. ([Trustpilot page](<https://www.trustpilot.com/review/oneprep.xyz>))

2. **Widespread coordinated Reddit manipulation:** Multiple accounts are running coordinated promotional campaigns on r/sat. The most prominent example: during the December 2025 SAT score release, a post reached 2,000+ upvotes before moderators identified and removed it for manipulation. The post followed the established pattern—account posts achievement, praises Oneprep in comments, coordinated accounts upvote and leave supportive comments to create artificial buzz.

This was not an isolated incident. The subreddit has seen a sustained pattern of:
- Accounts posting scores or "tips" that pivot to recommending Oneprep
- Coordinated commenting where multiple accounts praise the platform in the same threads
- Artificial upvoting to push promotional content to the top
- New accounts with limited history suddenly appearing to recommend Oneprep

The 2,000+ upvote post is simply the most visible example of a broader, ongoing campaign.
